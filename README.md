The University of Montana, located in the United States, provides various student support services, including a library. The university library offers several services to students, such as study room reservations, books, computers, group discussions, webinars, and more. All these services and many others are available within the library's own webpage, and students can access it to schedule any of the available services. The page features a university banner, a search bar, three main access categories, and a right sidebar displaying the latest news.

During the period from April 3, 2013, to April 10, 2013, the library's homepage received 10,819 visitors. Upon analyzing the page access data, the university's IT team noticed a significant difference in the access rates of the page categories. The click-through rate for "Find" was 35%, "Request" was 6%, and "Interact" was 2%. Observing the click-through rates, the IT team wondered why the conversion rate for the "Interact" category was so low.

One of the hypotheses proposed by the IT team was that the name "Interact" might confuse students as it does not clearly indicate the purpose of that category. Thus, four new names were proposed to replace the current category name: "Connect," "Learn," "Help," and "Service."

With variations of the category name in mind, an A/B/n test needed to be defined to validate which variation made the category more understandable and attractive to students, with the expectation of increasing the click-through rate in this category. Therefore, an A/B/n test was conducted over three weeks, from May 29, 2013, to June 18, 2013. The experiment was designed to ensure that a user would access any of the variations with the same probability.
